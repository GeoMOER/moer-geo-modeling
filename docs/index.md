One could claim that the fact living on the surface of the earth and only get to know a small space through direct personal experience is the most important motivation for most of the geographic work. Compensation for this lack of direct experience has been and is being made, especially in scientific geography, with the help of efficient spatio-temporal techniques of abstraction and modeling. 



# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able

* to understand, adapt and develop geographic concepts 

* to communicate your workflow and analysis results



# Preparation and prerequisites


It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too. 


# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on a portfolio hosted as a repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review the paper which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments .
